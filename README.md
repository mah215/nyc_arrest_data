# nyc_arrest_data
The purpose of this project is to depict NYC arrest data which would be useful to policy makers, authorities and even someone looking to buy a home. The first page depicts the number of arrests by borough when the user clicks the refresh button. The second page depicts the top three common offenses arrested for in each borough after the user selects one from the drop down.
